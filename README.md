# Coding_game_code
This is a repository of code with which challenges have been completed and have worked on my behalf.

Most of this code will be from C.o.C.s (Clash of Code)s which is where different challenges are given to coders in a lobby (see below for challenges) to complete in a language of their choice. 

sc_ = Shortest code challenge
qc_ = Quicket code challenge
re_ = Reverse engineer challenge
